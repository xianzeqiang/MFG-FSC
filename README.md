# MFG-FSC: Molecular Fingerprint Generation and Fuzzy Similarity Classification
This code comes from the paper entitled â€˜A Systematic Framework Enhancing Molecular Screening Efficiency in Drug Discovery via Scaffold-Driven Fuzzy Similarity and Adaptive Spectral Clusteringâ€™, which proposed a molecular similarity calculation method.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
A fuzzy logic-enhanced framework for molecular similarity analysis that replaces traditional binary thresholds with **5-level continuous classification**. Implements parallelized fingerprint generation and trapezoidal membership functions for pharmaceutical-grade molecular similarity evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
| **Feature** | **Innovation** |
|-------------|----------------|
| ðŸ”€ Fuzzy Classification | 5-level trapezoidal membership (VH/H/M/L/VL) |
| âš¡ Parallel Processing | Multi-threaded subcluster computation |
| ðŸ§ª Tanimoto Optimization | GPU-accelerated similarity scoring |
| ðŸ§¬ Dynamic Clustering | Automatic load-balanced subclustering |
